So, I was walking down the street.
<br> It was cloudy evening.
<br> I have something to do at that night so I was in hurry.
<br> But suddenly, I felt little different atmosphere.
<br> I turned my head to the right.

<br><h1> Someone's head was cut down.
  <br>It was a nice cutting performance.
  <br>Cause there was no blood.
  <br>I was quite scary.
<br>Leg was tumbling.
<br>Run, Run, Run</h1>
