Do you want to be there?
  <br>  <br>
<br>I am kind of willing to.
<br>But not too famous
Like if you see celebrities, I can not imagine how many things they are holding
to be there.
<br> Hoo
<br> I know it a concern about too much.
  <br> I do not even have things haha.
    <br>But you know,
    preparation is not a loss.
